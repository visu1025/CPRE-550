# Distributed System Monitoring using RPC
Developing Environment: 
The project is developed in C language using RPC middleware.
Design: 
The main objective of this project is to develop a monitoring system to track logins, system statistics and other system details remotely. The client can request a service and the processing is done at the server side. The client gets the output from the server.
The .x file is the interface written to regulate the communication between server and client. There are seperate server code, client code and stub files for server and client respectively.
The code has a sanitized input function defined to accept only integers but not any other input from the user.
